### bamazon

Is a cli that allows a user to view and purchase products from the bamazon store. The program begins by asking the user what they would like to purchase. They can do this by either entering in the id number or by selecting the product from the dropdown menu. If there is sufficient amount of the product in stock, it will return the total for that purchase.
However, if there is not enough of the product in stock, it will tell the user that there isn't enough of the product and the program will then run from the beginning asking for the product needed and quantity.
If the purchase goes through, it updates the stock quantity in the databaseto reflect the purchase and displays the total for the purchase.
